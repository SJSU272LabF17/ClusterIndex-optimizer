## Project-Team-13

A cluster index is a structure that sorts and stores the entries in the table and expedite the process of data retrieval in table and views. Indexing is now one of the vital components in the data retrieval process lifecycle.

In our project, we observe the various queries which are being performed on the tables. After careful analysis, we log the complex queries into a log file 
which is used later for performing clustering operation. We parse the log and give weight to the operation performed based on the complexity and resourse required by the operation. At the end of parsing, we find the best suitable column which is to be considered for clustering.

After deciding on the columns, we perform indexing operation on the MySQL to further inhance the performance of data retrieval.
